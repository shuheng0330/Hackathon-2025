# Hackathon-2025




This project is developed for UMHackathon 2025: Balaena Quant Problem Statement, which challenges participants to create an alpha-generating trading strategy using Machine Learning (ML) models applied to on-chain crypto data.

Our solution uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect implicit market regimes and generate high-frequency trading signals with the goal of maximizing returns while managing risk.
